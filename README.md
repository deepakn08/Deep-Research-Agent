# 🧠 Deep Research AI Agent

This project is a Streamlit-based interactive research assistant powered by LangGraph and autonomous agents. It allows users to input a query, after which the system crawls the web, extracts relevant information, and drafts an AI-generated answer — all using a dual-agent setup.

## 🔍 Methodology

The core idea is built on **LangGraph**, which enables agentic workflows using a graph of nodes (agents). Here's the process:

### 🔗 Agentic System Architecture:

1. **Query Input**  
   The user enters a question via the Streamlit UI.

2. **Web Crawling Agent (Node 1)**  
   - Uses the **Tavily API** to perform a deep web search.
   - Each URL is scraped using **BeautifulSoup**, extracting text data.
   - A list of document snippets is returned as `docs`.

3. **Answer Drafting Agent (Node 2)**  
   - Uses an **LLM (LLaMA-3 via Groq)** to draft an answer.
   - The LLM is prompted with the user query and the crawled content.

4. **Graph Execution**  
   - The graph is built using `langgraph`, with nodes for crawling and drafting.
   - Upon query submission, the state flows through the graph and the final response is shown.

5. **Streamlit UI**  
   - Interactive, loop-based interface mimicking a chat-like experience.
   - Supports session memory to retain previous conversations.
